This project aims to provide a tutorial for LibreOffice Calc users who want to get started with writing macros using the Basic language.

The tutorial starts with a typical "Hello World" example to show how macros are organized and covers aspects that are both related to the Basic Language and how it can be used to communicate with LO Calc.

## Acknolwedgements

The contents in this tutorial is based on books, blog posts and responses to questions made by users in many forums. I would like to mention two important sources used to prepare this tutorial:

- Andrew Pitonyak's book entitled *OpenOffice.org Macro Information* is a precious source of information and has serve as my main reference in this tutorial. I highly recommend everyone interested in Basic programming to give this book a good read. It also addresses macro writing for other LibreOffice applications, such as Writer, Impress and Draw.
- Questions answered on Ask LibreOffice about topics related to macro programming. I appreciate the efforts from the LibreOffice community in providing such good answers that can later be used as reference by other users.
