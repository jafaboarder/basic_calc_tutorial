:warning: **Disclaimer**

This project is still in a very early stage and few topics are ready. Feel free to open Issues to propose topics you would like to see covered in this tutorial.

This project aims to provide a tutorial for LibreOffice Calc users who want to get started with writing macros using the Basic language.

The tutorial starts with a typical "Hello World" example to show how macros are organized and covers aspects that are both related to the Basic Language and how it can be used to communicate with LO Calc.

Ckeck out the [Hello World](./topics/Hello_World.md) topic.

## Requesting new Topics

If you would like to suggest new topics to be covered in this tutorial, please open as Issue and give a brief description of the topic along with examples that could help create the content.

## Compatibility

All examples were created using LibreOffice 7.0 and were run on a Ubuntu 20.04 machine. However, all examples are supposed to work on Windows and MacOS as well.

## Acknowledgements

The contents in this tutorial are based on books, blog posts and responses to questions made by users in many forums. I would like to mention two important sources used to prepare this tutorial:

- Andrew Pitonyak's [book](https://www.pitonyak.org/book/) entitled *OpenOffice.org Macros Explained* is a precious source of information and has served as my main reference in this tutorial. I highly recommend everyone interested in Basic programming to give this book a good read. It also addresses macro writing for other LibreOffice applications, such as Writer, Impress, Base and Draw.
- Questions answered on Ask LibreOffice about topics related to macro programming. I appreciate the efforts from the LibreOffice community in providing such good answers that can later be used as reference by other users.

I also recommend reading Chapter 13 of LibreOffice's [Getting Started Guide](https://nextcloud.documentfoundation.org/s/BqZrc5KpLYao4Ed), which gives a nice overview of how macros are organized, as well as how you can record and run macros.
